    <h1>La vie d'Ada</h1>
    <p>Augusta Ada King, Countess of Lovelace (née Byron; 10 December 1815 – 27 November 1852), also known as Ada Lovelace, was an E
        nglish mathematician and writer chiefly known for her work on Charles Babbage's proposed mechanical general-purpose computer, 
        the Analytical Engine. She was the first to recognise that the machine had applications beyond pure calculation. Lovelace was the 
        only legitimate child of poet Lord Byron and reformer Anne Isabella Milbanke. All her half-siblings, Lord Byron's other children, 
        were born out of wedlock to other women. Lord Byron separated from his wife a month after Ada was born and left England forever. 
        He died in Greece when she was eight. Lady Byron was anxious about her daughter's upbringing and promoted Lovelace's interest 
        in mathematics and logic in an effort to prevent her from developing her father's perceived insanity. Despite this, Lovelace 
        remained interested in her father, naming her two sons Byron and Gordon. Upon her death, she was buried next to her father at 
        her request. Although often ill in her childhood, Lovelace pursued her studies </p>
    <p>Le nom de l'école Ada Tech School s'inspire de cette mathématicienne.</p>
